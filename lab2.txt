Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
          You use socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) function
          where INET is the IPV4 socket and SOCK_STREAM denotes the TCP type of
          socket.

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket
in Python?
          The server program waits for a client to connect and ask for
          information or send information that it serves or processes.

          server socket initiates and listens for any connection. The client
          socket connects and binds to the socket and sends data. The server
          socket serves the information. The client socket unbinds after its
          job is done.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
          s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
          by setting the socket option to SO_REUSEADDR.

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
          We get its host name (ip) and the port.

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done
sending the HTTP request?
          The same data that was sent by the client socket is echoed back.
